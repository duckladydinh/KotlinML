# KotlinML, Kotlin for Machine Learning
KotlinML is a new - and probably the first of its kind - framework for Machine Learning in Kotlin with support for automated hyperparameter optimization (Bayesian Optimization), LightGBM and L-BFGS-B (the C/C++ binding is from another project though).

To welcome the great news that Kotlin for Data Science will be officially supported (December 2019), we aim to make something similar to sklearn and scipy for Kotlin. Will this last more than a school project? Or will it evolve into a work of the same scale of its counterpart in Python? Only time can answer, but I will do my best to keep this project alive!
